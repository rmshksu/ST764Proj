# Model Checking {-}

Checking the predictive accuracy of our model is the next step in this process. There are numerous methods for performing model checks and their efficacy varies based on the data/model/function being used. 

For this project and tutorial we'll be using 4 separate methods:

- Regression Diagnostics

- Graphical Diagnostics

- Within-Sample Validation

- Forecasting
